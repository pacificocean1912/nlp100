# NLP 100 Exercise 2020 (Rev 2) - Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the NLP 100 Exercise 2020 (Revision 2), a comprehensive bootcamp for learning programming, data analysis, and research skills through practical NLP assignments.

## Overview

The NLP 100 Exercise covers fundamental to advanced topics in Natural Language Processing through 10 key sections:

1. **Warm-up** - Advanced programming topics and text handling
2. **UNIX commands** - Practical implementation of UNIX tools for data analysis
3. **Regular Expression** - Information extraction from Wikipedia markups
4. **POS tagging** - Word usage statistics from "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
5. **Syntactic parsing** - Dependency tree analysis of the same novel
6. **Machine learning** - Document classifier implementation and evaluation
7. **Word embeddings** - Word similarity, analogy, clustering, and visualization
8. **Neural networks** - Deep learning framework usage and document classification
9. **RNN and CNN** - Implementation of RNNs and CNNs
10. **Machine translation** - Neural machine translation system

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- NLTK data packages (for some exercises)
- UNIX-like environment (for Section 2)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp100-exercises.git
   cd nlp100-exercises
   ```

3. Download additional resources as needed for specific exercises.

## Usage

Each section contains its own implementation files and documentation. Refer to individual exercise folders for specific usage instructions. the data and output files are missing due to limited github space
